# Decentralised-Graded-System
The ongoing expansion of the internet has made virtually gone all online. The technology to support such expansion also evolved with it. But the one thing, that hasnâ€™t kept up with the ever expansion of the digital world is the security and proof of work of any transaction or ledger storage in digital world. For this we introduce Blockchain, with a demonstrated project - Decentralised Graded System. With this system monitoring degrees, certificates, marksheet would be lot easier. While appending them illegally would be equally difficult to perform. So no more fake certificates to show. Finding true educa- tional background is lot easier with Blockchain. To be clear, while the blockchain contains transaction data, its not a replacement for databases, messaging technology, transaction processing, or business processes. The blockchain contains verified proof of transactions. However, while blockchain essentially serves as a database for recording transactions, its benefits extend far beyond those of a traditional database.
